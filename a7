Hi Tina,

Thank youâ€”this email really helps in excluding scenarios related to special characters.

Could you please review the following scenarios?

FirstName is null

FirstName contains numeric values

LastName contains numeric values

Scenario Details:

FirstName is null: When the data is rejected from the Landing table due to a null FirstName, it should appear in the error table. However, the entry is currently missing from both the Landing and error tables.

FirstName contains numeric values: When the data is rejected from the Landing table due to numeric characters in the FirstName, the corresponding record should appear in the error table with a specific error message such as:
"First Name should not have numeric values", instead of a generic error.

LastName contains numeric values: Similar to the above, when LastName has numeric values and is rejected from the Landing table, the entry should be recorded in the error table with a specific error message such as:
"Last Name should not have numeric values".
