Title: Add Support for ddm_columns in EDFLConfig YAML Specification

As a data platform engineer,
I want to include the ddm_columns field in the EDFLConfig YAML configuration,
so that sensitive columns are automatically detected and handled (e.g. hashed) during data load operations.

Background
The current YAML configuration template used for defining ingestion specs in the data platform is missing the ddm_columns section. This section is necessary to define columns that should undergo data de-identification (e.g., hashing) to meet compliance and data privacy requirements.

The structure should follow the format:

yaml
Copy
Edit
ddm_columns:
  ColumnName1: Hashed
  ColumnName2: Hashed
An example exists in another config where columns like sCContact, iCOriginalAccount, and iCAccount are clearly marked for hashing.

Acceptance Criteria
 ddm_columns block is supported and validated in the YAML configuration schema.

 The values under ddm_columns support types like Hashed.

 The ingestion process applies transformations (e.g., hashing) based on these definitions.

 Backward compatibility is maintained for configurations that do not include ddm_columns.

Tasks
Update YAML templates to support ddm_columns.

Modify the ingestion logic to read and apply DDM transformations.

Validate config changes with sample datasets.

Update documentation and examples to reflect the new field.
