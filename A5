Subject: Observations from Azure VDI Production - Discrepancies in Data Load and Error Capture

Email Body:

Hi Team,

I have completed a review of the data load process in the Azure VDI Production environment and would like to share the following observations for your attention:
	1.	Several policies (e.g., MR025301, MR025306) were expected to be present in the Landing table but were rejected without being captured in the DQ_Errors or Error table, indicating a possible issue in error handling.
	2.	Policies such as MR025302 to MR025305 were rejected even though no error was captured in DQ_Errors – this behavior is inconsistent with expected functionality.
	3.	For policies MR025307 and MR025308, although specific errors like “Last name is required” were expected, the rejections occurred without the corresponding entries in the Error table.
	4.	On the other hand, policies like MR025309 to MR025318 behaved as expected, where data was either correctly rejected and captured in the Error table or successfully landed.

These inconsistencies need to be investigated to ensure proper error logging and reliable data val
