This is my dataset. The firstname field contains values like “Wife”, which I believe should qualify as a fuzzy match.

However, these records have been loaded into the landing table. Could you please confirm if this is the expected behavior?
Shouldn’t the logic be matching on a condition like firstname LIKE '%wife%'?

Also, could you clarify — is the match being treated as exact or fuzzy?
