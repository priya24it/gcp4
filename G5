What to Do

If you want to match only .csv files (regardless of name):



"use-file-patterns": "Y",
"all-file-patterns": "*.csv"


"use-file-patterns": "N",
"file-prefix": "*",  // or leave it blank if your system treats "*" as "all"
"file-suffix": "csv"


If both are being used, your current config creates ambiguity.
